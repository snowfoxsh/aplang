# Privacy Policy
The ApLang interpreter collects no user Data.

# Networking
Currently the aplang interpreter has ***no*** networking capabilites. Should the intrepreter later include the ability to connect the the network, it will only do so either:
- At the users request (ie. they execute source code that calls a function to a web request or open a socket)
- To check for updates or remind the user to update aplang software. Should this ever be implemented users will be able to opt out with compile time flags.
