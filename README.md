# Ap Lang
A language designed to aid students who are taking the AP Computer Science Principals exam. 

## Quick Start
Come back later...

## Accessibility
The goal with this project is accessibility first. It is understood that the vast majority of people who will 
use the interpreter are new to programming. Therefore, it is of the upmost import that installation is made simple and 
documentation is extensive. Linux is wonderful however windows support, macOS and Web support must be put first
simply because those are the systems that most new programmers will use.


## For Students
I made this project to make your life easier and to help YOU get a better grade on the AP Computer Science Principals Test. 
In return for my work I simply ask that you share this project with your teachers and fellow students. The more people
that know of it the better.


## Contributing 
I welcome all contributors with open arms. I will eventually make a guide for contributing but that will be done on
project v1.0. I apologize for my garbage commit messages in advance. If you have any questions feel free to add me on discord
at @dev_storm or contact me via email at storm_dev@winux.com. I will make a discord server as well as matrix chat if 
this project gains traction.

### Feature Request
Please submit an issue ticket

### A Note
I chose rust for this project because cargo is an amazing build system. Rust can run anywhere! 

#### For Collage Board
Please bring awareness to the project! I would love for it to become officially supported however unlikely that would be.
