# A Note

### For students
Hello! I hope this software helps make your life a little better! (and maybe your grade). The most important thing you can do is tell your teacher and class about this project. I also humbly ask you to consider making a free GitHub account and "staring" this repo. Both of these actions help the project to reach as many people as possible. 

### For Teachers
Please consider using this tool in your class.

### For The Collage Board
As small of a possibility as it is, consider officially recognizing this project.

## Contributing
I welcome contributors of all skill levels. Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you are interested.
